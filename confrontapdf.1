.SH NAME
confrontapdf \- compare two PDF files textually or visually
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B confrontapdf
.RI [ file1 ]
.RI [ file2 ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page very briefly documents the \fBconfrontapdf\fP command.
.PP
\fBConfrontaPDF\fP is an application used to compare two PDF files in console mode or GUI.
.br
By default the comparison is of the words on each pair of pages, but
comparing character by character is also supported (e.g., for
logographic languages). And there's also support for comparing the pages
by appearance (for example, if a diagram is changed or if a paragraph is
reformatted, or a font changed). It is also possible to compare
particular pages or page ranges. For example, if there are two versions
of a PDF file, one with pages 1-12 and the other with pages 1-13 because
of an extra page having been added as page 4, they can be compared by
specifying two page ranges, 1-12 for the first and 1-3, 5-13 for the
second. This will make ConfrontaPDF compare pages in the pairs (1, 1), (2,
2), (3, 3), (4, 5), (5, 6), and so on, to (12, 13).
It is also possible to write the result of the comparison in an XML file.
It is possible to generate a PDF document with the differences between the
given documents.
